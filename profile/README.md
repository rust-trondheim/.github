# Rust Trondheim

## What we're about

Hello and welcome to our little corner ðŸ¦€ We are people who are interested in the Rust language! Beginners are absolutely welcome, most of us are too.

The purpose of this group is to meet up monthly to code and talk about Rust.

Maybe we'll also hack on some Open Source projects together?
